# Getting Started with Hugo: First Step Toward Automation

## Download Hugo 

There are three main ways to download hugo:

1. [Prebuilt binaries](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/#prebuilt-binaries): These are zip files that you can extract to obtain executables(called binaries).
2. [Package Managers](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/#package-managers): These are tools that can install hugo with a single command, these may or may not be already present in your Operating system, 
	
	- for Linux: [See all tools, its worth it have a look](https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/#package-managers)
	- for windows: `Chocolatey`, `Scoop`, `Winget`
	- for MacOS: `Homebrew`, `MacPorts`
	
3. [Build from Source](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/#build-from-source): It means compiling a software from the source code instead of pre-compiled or pre-built version like an executable(prebuilt-binaries)
