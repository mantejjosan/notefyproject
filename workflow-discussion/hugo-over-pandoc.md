# Why Hugo is Better Than Pandoc for Our Use Case

## Use Case Overview
Our primary need is to **convert Markdown to HTML**, with the additional requirements of rendering **math equations**, **chemical equations**, and utilizing **Mermaid.js** for diagrams. Unfortunately, **Pandoc** does not adequately meet these needs, making **Hugo** the superior choice.

## Key Arguments for Choosing Hugo

### 1. **Seamless Markdown to HTML Conversion**
Hugo excels in converting Markdown into well-structured HTML effortlessly. Its built-in Markdown support is robust and tailored for web publishing, making it an ideal solution for generating static sites.

  To convert Markdown to HTML using **Hugo**, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Hugo site** (if you haven’t done so already):
   ```bash
   hugo new site your-site-name
   cd your-site-name
   ```

2. **Add a theme** (you can choose any theme from [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)):
   ```bash
   git init
   git submodule add https://github.com/themename/hugo-theme-name.git themes/hugo-theme-name
   ```

3. **Create a new Markdown content file**:
   ```bash
   hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   ```

4. **Edit the Markdown file** (found in the `content/posts/` directory) to add your content. Use Markdown syntax for your text, math equations, and Mermaid diagrams.

5. **Build the site** to convert Markdown files into HTML:
   ```bash
   hugo
   ```

   This command generates your HTML files in the `public/` directory.

6. **Serve the site locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```

   You can view your site in a browser at `http://localhost:1313`.

### Summary Command for Markdown to HTML Conversion
After you’ve set everything up and added your Markdown files, the key command to convert Markdown to HTML is:
```bash
hugo
```

This command compiles your Markdown files into HTML, taking into account your site’s configuration and templates. The resulting HTML files will be located in the `public/` directory.

### 2. **Native Support for Math Equations**
- **Hugo** integrates easily with **KaTeX** or **MathJax**, allowing users to write LaTeX-style math equations directly in Markdown. This functionality enables clear and accurate representation of complex equations in the final HTML output.

- **Pandoc**, on the other hand, does support math, but it requires additional configuration and might not render as smoothly in a web context compared to Hugo’s native support.

### 3. **Chemical Equations Rendering**
- While **Hugo** does not natively support chemical equations, it can render them through **MathJax** using LaTeX syntax, offering more flexibility and control over how equations appear.

- **Pandoc** has limited functionality for chemical equations, often resulting in cumbersome workarounds. This adds unnecessary complexity to the workflow.

### 4. **Mermaid.js Integration**
- **Hugo** allows for the direct embedding of **Mermaid diagrams** using shortcodes. This makes it incredibly easy to create and render diagrams in your Markdown files without needing to rely on external scripts or filters.

- In contrast, **Pandoc** lacks native support for Mermaid.js, requiring complex custom filters or scripts to achieve similar functionality. This makes the process of including diagrams tedious and error-prone.

### 5. **Speed and Efficiency**
- Hugo is renowned for its **fast build times**. It can handle large numbers of Markdown files efficiently, generating static HTML with minimal delay. This efficiency is particularly beneficial when iterating on content or making bulk changes.

- **Pandoc**, while capable of converting documents, often feels sluggish and cumbersome when dealing with larger projects, particularly when rendering complex documents with math or diagrams.

### 6. **Customization and Theming**
- With Hugo, you have access to a wide range of themes and templates that allow for easy customization of your website's appearance. You can create visually appealing pages that enhance the user experience and presentation of your content.

- **Pandoc** does not offer a templating system for web output, meaning you’ll have to manually style your HTML or rely on external CSS, which can lead to inconsistent results and additional overhead.

## Conclusion
For our specific use case of converting Markdown to HTML with support for rendering math equations, chemical equations, and utilizing Mermaid.js for diagrams, **Hugo** clearly outshines **Pandoc**. 

While Pandoc may be powerful for document conversion, it fails to deliver a streamlined, efficient workflow for web publishing. The lack of native support for key features and the need for cumbersome workarounds make it a less favorable choice.

By choosing Hugo, we can enjoy a smoother, faster, and more efficient process, allowing us to focus on creating high-quality content without the frustrations associated with Pandoc.
